EDACC is a framework for the design, execution and analysis of large experiments with arbitrary algorithms on computer clusters. It automates
many of the tasks commonly done manually such as distributing the algorithm executables across compute nodes, running the required computation tasks
and collecting the results.

#### Core components

* Database: Stores information about algorithm executables, problem instances and experiments
* [GUI Application](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_gui): Java GUI application for managing algorithms and problem instances, creating and analysing experiments
* [Computation Client](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_client): Execution of the algorithms on remote, distributed systems such as computer clusters

#### Optional components

* [Web Frontend](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_web): Web client to perform monitoring and statistical analysis of experiment results
* Job server: Small application that increases the throughput of the system when large-scale grids are used
* Visualizer: Visualize the configuration process of algorithms and to analyze the results
* [Automatic algorithm configurator API](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_api): Java API for parallel automatic algorithm configurators
* [eAAC](https://github.com/EDACC/edacc_aac): Automatic configurator framework, which includes several automatic algorithm configurators

### <i class="icon-download"></i> Releases

The latest release contains the GUI application, which can be used to set up an EDACC database, and the computation client.
**We recommend working with the latest development versions.**

### <i class="icon-user"></i> Applications

EDACC was used to conduct the [SAT Challenge 2012](http://baldur.iti.kit.edu/SAT-Challenge-2012/) ([Web Frontend](http://satcompetition.org/edacc/SATChallenge2012/)) and the [SAT Competition 2013](http://www.satcompetition.org/2013/) ([Web Frontend](http://satcompetition.org/edacc/SATCompetition2013/)) and in tuning some of the SAT solvers that participated in these competitions (see [publications](#publications))
